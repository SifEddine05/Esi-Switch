# ESI-switch

This GitHub repository contains a web application that helps manage the local network of the National Higher School of Computer Science. The school has a large local network, and managing its configuration and different VLANs across multiple buildings and floors is becoming increasingly difficult for the network service team. Currently, they use Google Sheets to manage switch configurations, which is time-consuming and makes accessing network statistics challenging. The main objective of this project is to develop an application that facilitates the monitoring of switches and their configurations accurately and instantly.

The application must provide features that allow the service team to track the location of switches, the different VLANs used in the switches, the number of ports for each VLAN, cascade ports, the type of ports, the MAC address of the switch, and the inventory number of the switch. All inputs and outputs will be defined by the team.

The web application interface will be developed in collaboration with the network service team and will follow Windows standards. The software will have online help available in French, and the help will be context-sensitive and relative to each screen.

The project includes detailed documentation and a guide for installation. During the trial phase, users will receive assistance and training.
